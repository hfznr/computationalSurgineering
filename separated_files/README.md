# computationalSurgineering

## Introduction

Computational Surgineering is designed to bridge the gap between computational techniques and practical surgical applications.
This project aims to provide tools, libraries, and frameworks to assist in the real time surgical tool detection with mobile application. Our goal is to enhance the precision, safety, and outcomes of surgical interventions through the integration of computational methods.

## Features
- **Calibration Matrix Finder:** First
- **Red and Green Color:** Color detection to detect the tool position.
- **3D point Detection:** Frameworks for simulating surgical interventions and predicting outcomes.
- **Network Connection:** TCP Connection in local network. It can be connected from local devices in network. Just be sure that port 5555 is not used for other purposes.
- **3D Location Simulation:** Analytical tools for post-operative outcomes and procedural optimizations.
